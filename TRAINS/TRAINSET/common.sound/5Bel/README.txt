Brighton Belle Sound Pack
Released : November 2004
Version 1.0

Sounds: Uses the UK Coach sounds of Jeff Ashton and Stuart Williamson, modified to include electric motor coach sounds by Mark Wiles.  Thanks to both for their generous consent to use their hard work and sound recordings.


THIS SOUND PACKAGE IS FREEWARE.  HOWEVER IT IS COPYRIGHT.  YOU MAY NOT REPRODUCE, SELL, REDISTRIBUTE OR MODIFY THIS MODEL WITHOUT THE EXPRESS CONSENT OF THE AUTHORS.

To Load.

Unzip into a COMMON.SOUND folder within your TRAINS/TRAINSET folder.  You will probably have a folder already called common.sound as many freeware and payware products use alias to save on disk space.  If you havent, you will need to create a new one which must be called common.sound for the aliasing to work.  All three units use the same file.  It can, of course, also be used for other driving motor coach units.

In the unzipped file you will find replacement eng and wag files in a seperate folder.  These should replace the files in your existing Belle unit files, and alias to the sound files, saving you the hassle of editing the eng and wag scripts.

Any problems go to the UK Train Sim site (http://www.uktrainsim.com) forums and post a message asking for help.  Politely of course.

Warning.  These files are very complex with many sound streams running in parallel.  If your machine is not equipped with a good sound card or is of a lower spec, you may have some problems hearing all the sounds.  There isn't much that can be done about that unfortunately, but they should work on the vast majority of machines.

And Finally.  Yes, that is a whistle you can hear.  The Southern used air whistles on electric trains right up until the mid sixties, so for the brown and cream era the whistle is correct.  However, in the blue grey era the horn was used.  The default Class 50 horn is included in the file, but you will need to edit DMSeng.sms and DMScab.sms to replace the whistle reference with the horn file name.  It's easy enough, but again if you get problems post something on UKTS.

And finally finally - before you change or edit anything, for God's sake (and that of your own temper and sanity) BACK UP WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE!!!
